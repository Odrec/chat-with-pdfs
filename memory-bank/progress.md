## Current Tasks

**2025-03-21 15:36:00**

- Created implementation plan for fixing PDF annotation scoping issue (`memory-bank/pdf_annotation_per_document_plan.md`)
- Plan involves creating document-specific response storage and updating annotation creation logic

## Next Steps

- Implement document-specific response storage in app_modular.py
- Update annotation creation logic to use document-specific responses
- Add cleanup for document-specific responses when documents are deleted
- Test implementation with multiple documents to ensure annotations appear only in the correct document


## Additional Issue Identified

**2025-03-21 15:44:30**

During testing, we discovered a Streamlit-specific issue with the PDF annotation implementation:

- Annotations are correctly stored per document in `st.session_state.document_responses`
- However, Streamlit doesn't automatically refresh the PDF viewer with annotations after generating a response
- Annotations only become visible after the next user interaction (e.g., when typing a new question)

## Updated Next Steps

1. Implement a forced page rerun after storing the response and displaying it in the chat container
2. This can be done by adding `st.rerun()` after processing the response
3. Ensure the PDF viewer is properly refreshed with the new annotations immediately


## Completed Tasks

**2025-03-21 15:51:00**

- Implemented document-specific response storage using `st.session_state.document_responses`
- Updated annotation creation logic to use document-specific responses
- Added cleanup for document-specific responses when documents are deleted
- Fixed Streamlit refresh issue by adding `st.rerun()` after response generation
- Tested implementation with multiple documents to confirm annotations appear correctly

The implementation for document-specific PDF annotations is now complete and working correctly. Annotations are properly scoped to their respective documents and appear immediately after a response is generated.

[2025-03-21 16:06:22] - Created implementation plan for adding clickable links between sources and PDF annotations. This feature will allow users to click on citation numbers in responses or sources in the expander to jump to the corresponding annotation in the PDF viewer.
* Investigate optimization techniques for large documents
* Evaluate additional LLM integrations beyond OpenAI

## Completed Tasks

**2025-03-21 16:36:00**

- Fixed citation button key collision issue that was causing errors when generating responses
- Created detailed implementation plan in `memory-bank/citation_buttons_fix_plan.md`
- Added `generate_unique_component_key` function to `src/utils.py` to create guaranteed unique keys for Streamlit UI components
- Updated citation buttons in chat response to use unique keys, preventing key collisions
- Updated source view buttons in source expander to also use unique keys
- Added error handling around button generation to prevent app crashes
- Tested implementation to ensure citation buttons work properly without key collisions


**2025-03-21 16:44:00**

## Current Tasks

- Identified new issue with citation button implementation: buttons disappear entirely after fix
- Created revised implementation plan in `memory-bank/citation_button_fix_revised.md`
- Developed solution using stable key generation approach that preserves buttons across reruns

## Next Steps

1. Implement the revised key generation function `generate_stable_component_key()`
2. Update citation button implementations to use stable keys
3. Test to ensure buttons persist across reruns while avoiding collisions
4. Verify navigation works correctly between chat responses and PDF annotations


**2025-03-21 16:49:00**

## Completed Tasks

- Implemented the revised citation button fix:
  - Added `generate_stable_component_key()` function to src/utils.py
  - Updated citation button implementation to use stable keys
  - Updated source view button implementation with the same approach
  - Maintained the existing `generate_unique_component_key()` function for other uses

## Next Steps

- Test the implementation to verify citation buttons appear and persist
- Verify navigation between citations and PDF annotations works correctly
- Monitor for any key collision errors during normal use


**2025-03-21 17:12:00**

## New Approach Identified

- Discovered a better solution for the citation button issue: using Streamlit's callback pattern instead of custom keys
- This approach eliminates key collision issues entirely by letting Streamlit handle key generation internally
- Created detailed implementation plan in `memory-bank/citation_button_callback_solution.md`

## Next Steps

1. Switch to Code mode to implement the callback-based solution
2. Refactor citation buttons to use `on_click` with callback functions instead of return values
3. Update source view buttons with the same pattern
4. Remove explicit `st.rerun()` calls as they're not needed with callbacks


## 2025-03-21: Citation Button Persistence Fix

### Status: Completed

After investigating the issues with citation buttons disappearing, we've implemented a solution that stores citation information in session state and ensures buttons persist across Streamlit reruns.

### Key Changes:
- Store citation numbers in session state for persistence
- Create buttons with explicit unique keys including position index and response ID
- Remove duplicated rerun calls in annotation handler
- Use the same citation data throughout the code for consistency
- Add debug logging to track button creation

### Root Cause:
When Streamlit reruns the app (especially after annotation clicks), dynamic UI elements like buttons were being recreated without preserving their state. The double `st.rerun()` call in the annotation handler was particularly problematic. Additionally, button IDs were colliding when multiple citations referenced the same source.

A set-based deduplication approach along with persistent session state fixed both issues.

[2025-03-31 11:51:00] - Completed removal of citation button functionality that was not working correctly. Annotations are still visible in PDFs, and citation numbers still appear in responses, but the buttons and automatic jumping behavior have been removed to simplify the application.


## 2025-03-31 15:50:00 - Recent UI and Functionality Improvements

### Completed Tasks

- **Query Suggestions Implementation**:
  - Added `generate_query_suggestions()` function to create contextually relevant questions for each document
  - Implemented Streamlit pills component for displaying clickable query suggestions
  - Integrated query pill selection with chat query processing

- **Citation Source Display Fix**:
  - Fixed issue where source numbers didn't match citation references in responses
  - Modified source display logic to filter sources based on citation numbers actually used in text
  - Ensured consistent source storage between regular queries and pill-initiated queries

- **UI Spacing Improvements**:
  - Identified and resolved excessive space between container tabs and chat content
  - Fixed by moving height calculation code outside the chat_tab context
  - Improved overall user interface appearance and increased usable space

### Next Steps

- Explore further query suggestion improvements (e.g., dynamic regeneration of suggestions)
- Consider adding user ability to customize the number of query suggestions shown
- Optimize spacing calculations for different screen sizes and resolutions
- Add compact/expanded view toggle for chat interface

The citation buttons now generate with unique keys that work reliably across page reruns and don't cause key collision errors, improving the overall stability of the application's navigation system.
