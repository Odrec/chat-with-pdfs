# GitHub Push Plan for Chat-with-Docs

## Project Overview
Chat-with-Docs is a Streamlit-based application that allows users to upload PDF documents and have interactive conversations with them using LLM technology. The application provides features such as:

- PDF document upload and processing
- Text extraction and vectorization using LlamaIndex
- Image extraction with grid display
- Dual-retrieval approach (vector + keyword search)
- Citation mode with references
- Streamlit UI with tabbed interface for chat, document info, and images

## Git Setup Steps

### 1. Create a `.gitignore` File
First, we'll create a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from version control:

```
# Environment variables
.env

# Python
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class
.venv/
.roo/

# Streamlit
.streamlit/secrets.toml

# Project-specific
temp_files/
tmp_assets/
VectorStore/

# IDE
.vscode/
.idea/

# Miscellaneous
.DS_Store
```

### 2. Initialize Git Repository
```bash
git init
```

### 3. Add and Commit Files
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Chat-with-Docs application"
```

### 4. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to GitHub (https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click "New" to create a new repository
3. Name your repository (e.g., "chat-with-docs")
4. Add a description: "Interactive PDF document chat application with LLM integration"
5. Choose visibility (public or private)
6. Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we'll push our existing code)
7. Click "Create repository"

### 5. Link Local Repository to GitHub
GitHub will provide commands similar to:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/chat-with-docs.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 6. Push Code to GitHub
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

## Additional Recommendations

### Create a README.md File
Consider adding a `README.md` file with:
- Project description and purpose
- Features list
- Installation instructions
- Usage examples
- Environment variables needed
- Dependencies
- Development setup

### License
Add an appropriate license file based on your preferences (MIT, Apache, GPL, etc.)

### GitHub Actions
Consider setting up GitHub Actions for:
- Automated testing
- Linting
- Building and deployment

## Ongoing Git Workflow
After initial setup, follow these best practices:
1. Create feature branches for new development
2. Make regular commits with descriptive messages
3. Use pull requests for code reviews
4. Keep the main branch stable
