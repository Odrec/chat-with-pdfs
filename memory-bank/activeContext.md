## Current Focus

**2025-03-21 15:36:00**

Addressing PDF annotation scoping issue to ensure annotations are properly tied to their source documents. The application currently has a bug where annotations from one document may appear in another document when switching between documents. We've created a detailed implementation plan in `memory-bank/pdf_annotation_per_document_plan.md` that outlines the changes needed to fix this issue by creating document-specific response storage.


## Implementation Complete: Document-Specific PDF Annotations

**2025-03-21 15:50:00**

We have successfully implemented document-specific PDF annotations. The key changes include:

1. Added `document_responses` dictionary to session state to store responses by document
2. Updated annotation creation logic to use document-specific responses instead of a global response
3. Added proper cleanup for document-specific responses when documents are deleted or chat is cleared
4. Fixed a Streamlit-specific issue by adding a forced page rerun to make annotations visible immediately

The implementation ensures that annotations are correctly scoped to their respective documents and appear immediately after a response is generated.

[2025-03-21 16:06:44] - Currently focusing on implementing clickable links between source citations and PDF annotations (Phase 1). This will allow users to click on citation numbers or sources to navigate to the corresponding annotation in the PDF viewer.

## Bug Fixed: Citation Button Key Collision

**2025-03-21 16:36:00**

A user reported an issue with the citation buttons not working properly. We identified the problem as a key collision in Streamlit UI components. When citation buttons were rendered, they were using a timestamp-based key that could result in duplicate keys if multiple responses were generated within the same second or if the UI refreshed rapidly.

We've fixed the issue by:

1. Adding a robust `generate_unique_component_key()` function to `src/utils.py` that creates guaranteed unique keys
2. Updating the citation button and source view button implementations to use these unique keys
3. Adding error handling to prevent app crashes if any issues occur with button generation

The implementation ensures that citation buttons now work reliably across page reruns without key collisions, improving the overall stability of the navigation system between chat responses and PDF annotations.


**2025-03-21 16:45:00**

## New Issue Identified: Citation Button Visibility

After implementing the key collision fix for citation buttons, we discovered that the buttons disappeared entirely from the UI. This is due to a crucial Streamlit behavior: elements with new IDs replacing previous elements causes the previous elements to be erased after a rerun.

Our previous solution created completely unique keys on every rerun using timestamps and incrementing counters, which made Streamlit treat them as new elements rather than updates to existing ones.

We've created a revised implementation plan in `memory-bank/citation_button_fix_revised.md` that focuses on generating stable keys that remain consistent across reruns for the same citation. This should make the buttons persist while still preventing key collisions.


**2025-03-21 16:51:00**

## Citation Button Fix Implementation Status

We've implemented the revised solution for the citation button visibility issue:

1. Created a new `generate_stable_component_key()` function in `src/utils.py` that generates keys that remain consistent across Streamlit reruns for the same component
2. Updated both citation buttons and source view buttons to use this stable key generation approach
3. Changed the context identifier from total chat history length to specific response index for better stability

The core insight driving this fix is understanding how Streamlit handles UI components with changing keys - elements with new IDs replacing previous elements causes the previous elements to be erased after a rerun. Our solution creates stable keys that persist across reruns while still maintaining uniqueness between different citations.

We're now waiting for testing feedback to confirm that citation buttons appear correctly and remain visible when interacting with the application.


**2025-03-21 17:06:00**

## Ongoing Issue: Citation Button Key Collisions

We've identified a continued issue with the citation button implementation. Even with our stable key generation approach, we're experiencing key collisions when multiple buttons with the same citation number appear in a response. The error message shows:

```
Citation button error: There are multiple elements with the same `key='resp_ea1b15e6_0_btn_1'`
```

We need to further refine our solution by adding another uniqueness factor (the button position/index) to our key generation. We've documented the approach in `memory-bank/citation_button_further_fix.md` and will switch to Code mode to implement the solution.


**2025-03-21 17:13:00**

## New Solution: Callback-Based Approach for Citation Buttons

Based on user feedback, we've identified a much better solution for the citation button issue - using Streamlit's callback pattern instead of explicit keys. This approach offers several significant advantages:

1. Completely eliminates key collision issues by letting Streamlit handle key generation internally
2. Simplifies the code by separating button display from action logic
3. Follows Streamlit best practices for handling UI component interactions

We've documented the full implementation plan in `memory-bank/citation_button_callback_solution.md` and will now switch to Code mode to implement this approach. The solution uses the `on_click` parameter with callback functions rather than relying on button return values or manual key management.

## Current Focus: Removing Citation Button Functionality

**2025-03-31 11:42:00**

After multiple attempts to fix the PDF annotation jumping functionality (where citation buttons should navigate to specific pages in the PDF), we've decided to remove this feature entirely while keeping the visual annotations in the PDFs.

The issue was that clicking on citation buttons would load the document but always return to the first page regardless of where the annotation was located. We've created a detailed removal plan in `memory-bank/citation_button_removal_plan.md` that outlines exactly which components to remove and which to keep.

Key aspects of the plan:
- Keep citation numbers in text responses and PDF annotations for visual reference
- Remove all interactive navigation buttons and click handlers
- Simplify the code by removing unnecessary navigation logic
- Ensure annotations still appear visually in the PDF viewer



## Current Focus: UI and User Experience Improvements

**2025-03-31 15:50:00**

We've implemented several UI and functionality improvements to enhance the user experience:

1. **Query Suggestions as Interactive Pills**
   - Added automatically generated query suggestions that appear as clickable pills above the chat interface
   - Implemented in the chat tab to help users explore document content without typing
   - When a suggestion is clicked, it's processed as a regular query and removed from available options

2. **Citation Source Display Fix**
   - Fixed an issue where source numbers in the source expander didn't match citation references in responses
   - Modified the source display logic to filter sources based on citation numbers actually used in text
   - Ensured consistent behavior between regular queries and pill-initiated queries

3. **UI Spacing Optimization**
   - Resolved excessive space between container tabs and chat content by moving height calculation code
   - The issue was caused by Streamlit adding extra padding when height calculations were performed inside tab contexts
   - Moving the code outside the chat_tab context but before the chat container creation eliminated the unwanted spacing

These changes have significantly improved the application's usability and appearance, providing a more intuitive and space-efficient interface for document interaction.


## Current Focus: Pushing to GitHub

**2025-03-31 15:53:00**

We're currently planning to push the Chat-with-Docs project to GitHub. Key steps include:

1. Creating a `.gitignore` file with appropriate exclusions
2. Initializing a Git repository
3. Adding and committing files
4. Creating a GitHub repository
5. Linking the local repo to GitHub
6. Pushing code to GitHub

A detailed plan has been documented in `memory-bank/github_push_plan.md`. Since the Architect mode can only modify Markdown files, we'll need to switch to Code mode to execute the actual Git commands and create non-markdown files like `.gitignore`.
